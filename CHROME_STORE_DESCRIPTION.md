**Title:** Teams Caffeine: Keep Your Microsoft Teams Status Active

**Short Description:** Never appear "Away" on Microsoft Teams again! Teams Caffeine keeps your status active automatically, preventing timeouts and inactivity indicators.

**Full Description:**

Tired of your Microsoft Teams status switching to "Away" just because you stepped away for a moment or got deep into focused work? Teams Caffeine is here to help!

Teams Caffeine is a simple, lightweight browser extension designed to keep your Microsoft Teams status consistently active. It works discreetly in the background by simulating subtle mouse movements on Teams pages at regular intervals, ensuring you always appear available when you need to be.

**Key Features:**

- **Stay Active:** Reliably prevents your Teams status from changing to "Away" or "Inactive".
- **Auto-Disable Timer:** Set the extension to automatically turn off after 1-24 hours for responsible usage.
- **Seamless Operation:** Runs quietly in the background without interrupting your workflow.
- **Easy to Use:** Simply toggle the extension on or off via the toolbar icon. Access settings through the gear icon for advanced options.
- **Privacy First:** We respect your privacy. Teams Caffeine requires minimal permissions and does **not** track, collect, or store any of your data. All activity simulation happens locally on your machine.
- **Lightweight:** Designed to be efficient and not slow down your browser.

**How it Works:**

Teams Caffeine simulates tiny mouse movements within the Microsoft Teams web application (teams.live.com and teams.microsoft.com) to mimic user activity, tricking Teams into thinking you're still active at your computer.

**Perfect for:**

- Remote workers who need to maintain an active presence during work hours.
- Anyone who wants to avoid constant status changes during periods of reading, thinking, or brief breaks.
- Users who value privacy and want a simple, focused solution with responsible usage features.
- Teams that require active status indicators but want to avoid manual status management.

Install Teams Caffeine today and keep your Teams status reliably active!
